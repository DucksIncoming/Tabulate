# Tabulate
An simple class planner for college/university

This website allows you to very easily lay out all of your required classes for your degree, including thier prerequisites and corequisites, to ensure that all your credits are completed by the end of your senior year. Simply add classes, fill out the relevant information, and drag classes around until all classes have their requirements met. This site is available at https://ducksincoming.github.io/tabulate.html/ or you can download the repository yourself. The UI is meant to be very intuitive, however if needed hovering over any of the buttons will give you more information about how everything works. Enjoy!

I'm not super likely to continue work on this into the future, I wanted to add automated class populating by uploading an HTML file of your DegreeWorks dashboard, however this didn't provide all the information the planner needs and isn't used universally. I might add a way to add classes from a text document upload to make things easier, but it's not a high priority for me right now.
